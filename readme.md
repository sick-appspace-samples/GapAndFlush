## GapAndFlush
Measure the distance between the edges of two surfaces (gap) and the orthogonal distance between extensions of the surfaces (flush).
### Description
This sample uses line, circle and polynomial fitting to profiles and points for finding the gap and flush. Fixed radius circles are used to reduce fitting noise. Extracting profiles from heightmaps is demonstrated, as well as taking the mean across several profiles.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main' function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event. Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage. Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page. 
To run this sample a device with SICK Algorithm API is necessary. For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator on the latest AppStudio can be used.
